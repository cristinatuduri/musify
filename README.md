# Musify
A music recommendor app to discover new music
## Background
We are Business Administration and Data Analytics students. 
This is the respository of a project we have done for our Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning class.
It is not of high complexity, however it works well. 
Here are the steps we have followed: 
* With this website, we have exported one of our Spotify playists into a CSV file: https://exportify.net/#playlists
* Our dataset saved is called norette.csv
* Then, with the file formatting.ipynb, we have done some formatting of the dataset in order to tailor it for our next step.
* We have grabbed a file from this repository to perform data preprocessing, data understanding and analysis: https://github.com/sathishprasad/Music-Recommendation-System
* We have done two recommender systems: one as sort and range, and another with cosine similarity. To be found in the file: recommender.ipynb
